# Algorithms and Complexities 

Welcome to my **Algorithms and Complexities** repository! This is my personal space to document and share my journey of learning algorithms during my **2nd year, 2nd semester** as a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** student. Here, you'll find various algorithm implementations in C, along with explanations and insights gained from practice, professors, YouTube, and other valuable resources.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as:
1. A **learning hub** for practicing and understanding algorithms.
2. A **personal progress tracker** as I explore different problem-solving techniques.
3. A **resource for others**, including fellow students and self-learners, who are also on their algorithmic journey.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here
The repository is organized by algorithm types and their corresponding C implementations. Some of the key algorithms include:

### **Sorting Algorithms:**
- 📌 **Bubble Sort:** The simplest sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- 📌 **Selection Sort:** Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.
- 📌 **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting the element into its correct position.
- 📌 **Shell Sort:** An optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.
- 📌 **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
- 📌 **Quick Sort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array into smaller and larger elements.

###  **Searching Algorithms:**
- 🔍 **Linear Search:** Checks every element until the target value is found.
- 🔍 **Binary Search:** Efficient search by repeatedly dividing the sorted array in half.

### ⚙ **Other Concepts:**
-  **Recursion:** Implementing algorithms using recursive functions.
-  **Dynamic Programming:** Breaking down problems into simpler subproblems.
-  **Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues:** Exploring data structures essential for problem-solving.

## 📝 Learning Resources
I'm learning these algorithms through a combination of resources, including:
1. **Professors** – Classroom lectures and hands-on assignments.
2. **YouTube** – Channels like [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/c/AbdulBari), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp), and more.
3. **Practice Platforms** – LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
4. **Books & Articles** – "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen (CLRS).
5. **Peer Discussions** – Learning from friends and study groups.

##  Work in Progress
This repository will continue to grow as I explore more algorithms, optimize code, and deepen my understanding. I'll also add explanations and time complexities for each algorithm.

## 🤝 Contributions
While this repository primarily reflects my personal journey, contributions, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request, open an issue, or share resources.

## 💡 A Note to Myself
> "Learning algorithms isn't just about writing code but about understanding how to think through problems. Every challenge solved here brings me one step closer to becoming a better programmer."
